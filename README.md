## Installation
The python packages used in this project comes with the anaconda installation, hence no additional package should be needed to be installed separetely.

## Project Motivation
In this project I choose Stack Overflow data for 2019. Out of all these data I choose to explore data from the country Sweden.

## The questions answered in the project:
- What does the salary distribution look like for the individuals in the survey?

- Is age correlated with salary compensation?

- Is there are any correlation between job satisfaction and compensation?

- Does educational background affect compensation?


## Files and Descriptions:
- xxxx.pyng: Jupyter notebook file where data importing, cleaning and exploration has occured. All the code steps are commented with markdown cells in order to facilitate the understanding of the code and the notebook.

- xxxx.csv: Data file from Stackoverflow with the results from survey.

## Results
The answers to the questions stated above can be found in this blog post here: 

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Credit and acknowledgement to Stackoverflow for the data.
